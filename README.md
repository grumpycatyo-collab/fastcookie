# fastcookie
A predefined template for **FastAPI** projects, which includes all the things needed to start a new project quickly. It includes the folder structure, configuration files, a few example endpoints and a ready to use **Docker** setup. It is designed to be used as a starting point for new projects, so you can focus on writing your code instead of setting up the project structure.

To run this:

```shell
cookiecutter fastcookie
```
